# Since .env is gitignored, you can use .env.example to build a new `.env` file when you clone the repo.
# Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to \`.env\`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any secrets in it.
# If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named `.env` and populate it with your secrets.

# We use dotenv to load Prisma from Next.js' .env file
# @see https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls
# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.mjs"
# should be updated accordingly.
